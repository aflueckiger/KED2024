All true as long as you have your data ready. In this session, we begin with an introduction to the basic syntax of Python. Starting with basics is a dry matter; however, it allows you to use third-party libraries and get a handle on more sophisticated NLP analyses.\n  _"

Simon Schmid (journalist at Republik), in collaboration with Prof. Andreas Kley (Faculty of Law, UZH), collected many of these speeches and kindly shared the resulting dataset with me. The collection comprises 166 speeches, a multiple of the publicly available here.\nThe interactive visualization linked below shows how the language differs between speakers of Social Democratic Party of Switzerland (SP) and speakers of other parties. The top right corner shows terms that all parties have frequently used. In contrast, the top left and the lower right corner reveal words that have been used primarily by the members of the SP and correspondingly by the centre-right parties.\nYou can search for the terms of your interest. Moreover, you may click on the points in the plot to show the context of the corresponding words within speeches.

Building on a modern technology stack, it aims to prepare students to conduct data-driven text analysis and to make everyday life easier by fostering technological fundamentals. While learning about the importance of computation in solving problems, we also discuss the current developments in information technology. In short, the course promotes digital literacy on a practical and theoretical level.\nThis seminar focuses on the computational processing of digital and digitized texts using Python and the command-line. For any empirical research, the systematic preparation and aggregation of data and the swift retrieval of information are critical. These tasks require the handling of various data forms, including data that is not yet structured in a tabular format. The seminar covers the complete workflow, from gathering textual data to analyzing an entire text collection to producing interactive visualizations. Sounds cool? It certainly is.\nAlong the way, we deal with questions like these:\n\nHow can texts be quantitatively exploited to complement the qualitative content analysis?\nWhat are regular expressions, and why are they so powerful in the context of computational text analysis?\nHow to download data automatically from websites and process en masse?\nHow can historical texts be extracted from PDFs using Optical Character Recognition (OCR)?\n\n Go to UniLu website\n Get course syllabus as PDF (updated version)"
